										------- Project 2a ---------
Implementation of Change-Making Problem using "Naive Recursive algorithm" and "Greedy Algorithm"
Make sure that Python source, of version greater than 3 has been installed on the machine using to run/test this project.

This project uses some of the standard python libraries installed with the Python source.

The folder consists of two batch files and 2 python files which are naive recurvise algorithm and greedy algorithm.

Make sure both batch files and python files stay in same folder.

The programs take inputs as commandline arguments in the order of (a) an integer n representing the total change in cents, (b) number of denominations k, (c) k-size integer array d (i.e., d[1, 2, â€¦, k]) that represents the denomination set. (All these integers are to be separated by a space)

Double click on the chngmkGreedy.bat and chngmkRecursive.bat batch files to run the algorithms mentioned above in one shot (only works on Windows Operating System). The batch files work on the pre defined test data(given in canvas) and they can be viewed by editing the batch file or by running the batch files(in output console).

Each python file is designed to run individually as well. To run these files individually on user defined input, commandline arguments should be passed as mentioned above.

The output format will be as follows for Greedy Algorithm for Change-Making:
1) The first line will have a list of integers representing the coins used, and
2) The second line shows the time required to compute the solution in nanoseconds
