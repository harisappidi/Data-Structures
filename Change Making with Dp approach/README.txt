										------- Project 2b ---------
Implementation of Change-Making Problem using "Dynamic Programming algorithm"
Make sure that Python source, of version greater than 3 has been installed on the machine using to run/test this project.

This project uses some of the standard python libraries installed with the Python source.

The folder consists of one batch file and 1 python file which is Dynamic Programming algorithm.

Make sure that the batch file and python file stay in same folder.

The program takes input as commandline arguments in the order of (a) an integer n representing the total change in cents, (b) number of denominations k, (c) k-size integer array d (i.e., d[1, 2, â€¦, k]) that represents the denomination set. (All these integers are to be separated by a space)(Ex: python filename.py 11 4 1 5 10 25)

Double click on the chngmkDp.bat batch file to run the algorithm mentioned above in one shot (only works on Windows Operating System). The batch file works on the pre defined test data(given in canvas) and they can be viewed by editing the batch file or by running the batch files(in output console).

The python file is designed to run individually as well. To run the file individually on user defined input, commandline arguments should be passed as mentioned above.
For example: (Ex: python filename.py 11 4 1 5 10 25) 

The output format will be as follows for Dynamic programming Algorithm for Change-Making:
1) The first line will have a list of integers representing the coins used, and
2) The second line shows the time required to compute the solution in nanoseconds
